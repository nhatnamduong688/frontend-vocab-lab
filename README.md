# Project: JavaScript Technical Vocabulary Builder for Interview

## 🎯 Goal:

Extract and structure technical vocabulary from JavaScript interview articles (e.g., InterviewCake) to:

- Build a custom vocabulary bank
- Classify terms into Subject, Verb Phrase, Noun Phrase, and Adjective
- Practice sentence construction using English patterns such as:
  - [Subject] + [Verb Phrase] + [Noun Phrase]
  - By [V-ing], [Subject] + can + [Verb]
  - [Subject] + is + [Adjective]

## 🧩 Output Format:

Each extracted term should include:

- 📌 Phrase
- 📚 Type (Subject / Verb Phrase / Noun Phrase / Adjective)
- ✍️ Example sentence (simple B1–B2 level, in JavaScript context)

## ✨ Example:

| Phrase        | Type        | Example Sentence                                |
| ------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| event loop    | Subject     | The event loop manages async operations.        |
| handle errors | Verb Phrase | We handle errors using try/catch or .catch().   |
| memory leak   | Noun Phrase | A memory leak can affect performance over time. |
| asynchronous  | Adjective   | Asynchronous code allows better responsiveness. |

## 🛠 Tools:

- Cursor AI for assisted extraction & sentence suggestions
